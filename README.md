# nanaprint
A library for printing from nana gui applications.

[nana](https://nanapro.org) is a modern C++ cross-platform library for developing GUI applications.
It is a library, not a framework.
Therefore, much functionality is not included in nana, such as printing capabilities. nanaprint
is a library that
is intended to provide that missing functionality, thereby allowing printing in nana applications. 
Initially, it supports printing using
CUPS and Win32 APIs. Support for other printing libraries may be added at a later time.

As of this date, there is very little functionality implemented.
